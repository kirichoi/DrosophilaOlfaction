# DrosophilaOlfaction

Python scripts for analyzing *Drosophila* olfactory projection neuron reconstructions and reproducing the figures.
The original dataset is available from [Zheng et al. 2018](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30787-6) and the [Github repo](https://github.com/bocklab/temca2data/tree/master/geometry_analysis/data).
EM-reconstructed neuron skeleton data in .swc format and glomerulus labels will be needed to run the script.
